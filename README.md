# Voice Agent
MVP Voice Agent

## Goal

Create a voice agent that collects a series of information from a user.

A couple examples could be:

- schedules an appointment with a doctor
- makes a reservation with a restaurant
- mission control for a NASA scientist
- etc.

## Features

- Your voice agent should say goodbye when all necessary information are collected / tasks are completed
- Low latency if very preferred (sub 2 seconds)
- Your agent should be either in English / Arabic (or both)
- Should be deployed to the web (Daily or something of the like)
- (Bonus) Your agent should integrate with an external API e.g. "Tell me the current weather"
